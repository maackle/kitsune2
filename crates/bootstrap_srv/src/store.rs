//! This is a virtual-memory inspired tempfile store.
//!
//! ### Rationale
//!
//! - We don't need to persist anything in the store beyond a single
//!   process invocation, because the infos are going to expire after
//!   a matter of minutes anyways, and peers will continue to re-publish them.
//! - We would like a server to be able to store more spaces and infos
//!   than would reasonably fit in RAM.
//! - We would like to avoid use of an external database, to reduce
//!   dependencies and ease deployment and testing.
//!
//! ### Implementation
//!
//! - Have a pool of tempfiles that can grow to match the worker thread
//!   count if needed.
//! - Have the ability to Clone (reopen) these tempfile handles.
//! - Designate one file handle only per pool entry as writable.
//! - All other handles will be readonly.
//! - After writing an entry, return a reference with a readonly file handle
//!   to the tempfile that was written to, and an offset/length to
//!   allow readback of exactly the bytes written for that entry.
//! - Once a tempfile reaches a certain size, drop the write handle and
//!   open a new tempfile for writing.
//! - The older read handles will persist the existence of the older tempfiles
//!   until the last read reference is dropped, at which point the tempfile
//!   will be cleaned up by the os. The drop impls on the
//!   [tempfile::NamedTempFile] instances themselves will attempt the cleanup.
//!   If we find some systems (looking at you Windows...) fail to do the
//!   cleanup, we can add something more explicit in our code here.
//! - We can trust these files will cycle through at a rate similar to the
//!   max expiration time on the infos they contain (30 minutes).
